## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
#census_api_key("d7d4e42cde98b3f36a49086285318a4299967aec", install = TRUE)

```

```{r}
pop <- get_decennial(geography = "state",
                     variables = c("P001001", "P002005"),
                     year = 2010,
                     output = "wide",
                     geometry = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(prop_rural = (P002005/P001001)*100) %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_sf()
```
